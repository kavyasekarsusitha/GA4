2. Initialize a Git repository. Commit to the repo throughout the assignment as you see fit, but at least once for each “Part” of this assignment. Use and commit a .gitignore file as appropriate. (Tip: Many of you would do well to recall the feedback you got on your Git repo from the previous assignment!)

```bash
git init
touch .gitignore
```

3. Inside dir GA4, create a README.md file and open it in the VS Code editor. Use this file throughout the assigment to add your answers where appropriate.

```bash
touch README.md
```

4. Inside dir GA4, also create dirs scripts and results. We’ll make your dir self-contained again (like a typical situation for a research project) by copying some data into it:

```bash
mkdir scripts/ results/
```

5. As a starting script, store the code below in a shell script scripts/trimgalore.sh. This is a script to run TrimGalore, which should be very similar to your final script from last week’s exercises.

```bash
touch scripts/trimgalore.sh
```
